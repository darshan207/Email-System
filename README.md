# Email-System
This is a web-application developed by Darshan Parmar, Ronak Padaliya and Chandresh Gohel as a project of semester 5 of Computer Engineering at Dharmsinh Desai University. This application is developed in ASP.NET Framework. 

In this application we designed a basic Email system where user can make there account on this platform, with the help of this account they can send emails to their friend, family and colleagues. There is some additional feature that user can attach files with email, he/she can also mark some important mails as stared mail, a tresh is also there where deleted mails are visible and if user wants then can restore it. with this additional features there is all basic features included like Sign-up/Login, view email, view list of all mails as Inbox and many more. 

With the bootstrap framework, some additional CSS styles and some use of JavaScript we build responsive and better looking web application. also we tried to make it simple as well as user friendly.
